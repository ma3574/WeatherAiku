WeatherAiku (Weather-Haiku)

WeatherAiku is an application that tells you the weather, but with a twist! This application will only tell you the weather in the form of a Haiku, with one line being the temperature, one line the weather itself, and another the chance of rain or humidity (I am as of yet undecided).

This application is developed for FireFox OS on my shiny brand new Keon that HackSoc Nottingham won at OverTheAir 2013!
